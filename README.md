# subway-shenanigans
### A personal refresher for Python through an unserious simulation to discover the best method to maximize your time in the subway.

In June 2024, I backpacked Eastern Europe for 22 days. Given that I had no money and no intention to learn Bulgarian road signs, I took a lot of public transportation to get around cities. 
Of particular interest to me was the subway. Typically, after you get off a subway, an exit is on one side of the platform and depending on which car you are in the subway, it can take either 10 seconds to cross the entire platform to get out of the subway or the exit is right next to you. 
You also can't decide to just sit in the front car the whole time because the exits might switch from right to left and the front car might be the last car from the exit. 
Because I was cheap with my international data plan, I had a lot of time to myself and as a result, this question poppped into my mind. 
"What would be the best way for me to maximize my walking time from the subway to the exit"

For this simulation, I created three imaginary people, represented by random numbers. 

- Person 1, noted as P1, will only sit in the front car or the back car resulting on either 0 seconds to reach the exit or 10 seconds
- Person 2, noted as P2, will take completely random cars resulting in 0-10 seconds to reach the exit
- Person 3, noted as P3, will only take the middle cars resulting in any range from 3-7 seconds to reach the exit
